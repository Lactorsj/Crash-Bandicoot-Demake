### Visual Reference

You can modify the picture in the `\code\Assets\images` to customize the game for yourself!

1. The OBJECTS
    1. Basic crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\BasicCrate.png

        - The basic crate contains a small number of Wumpa fruit.

    2.  Bounce crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\bigcrate.png

        - The bouncing crate contains 10 Wumpa fruits and you must jump on the box to get them back.

    3. Arrow crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\boxFleche.png
    
        - The arrow crate allows Crash Bandicoot to jump higher (often to reach other boxes). It can only be destroyed with a tornado attack.
    
    4. Aku Aku crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\boxAku.png
    
        - The Aku Aku crate allows Aku Aku to level up (one more feather).

    5. Crash crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\boxCrash.png

        - The Crash crate allows Crash Bandicoot to recover an additional life directly.

    6. Iron crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\boxAcier.png
    
        - The iron crate cannot be destroyed.
    
    7. TNT crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\boxTNT.png
    
        - The TNT crate explodes if you make a spin attack. If you jump on the TNT crate, a 3-second timer is triggered, and the crate explodes at the end of it.
    
    8. Nitro crate: code\Assets\images\boxes\boxNitro.png
    
        - The Nitro crate explodes at the slightest contact, whether with a jump or a spin attack.
    
    9. Wumpa fruit: code\Assets\images\boxes\wumpa.png
    
        - The Wumpa fruit is an object to be recovered all along the level. If Crash Bandicoot manages to collect 100 Wumpa fruits, he earns an extra life in exchange for his last ones.


2.  HAZARDS

    1. Hole: code\Assets\images\obstacles\fire.png

### About This Project 

Crash Bandicoot Demake - a Group Project of Hebut & University-365 Students

Last year, our AIR380 system ---- "Sparrow V1.0" received a lot of praise from social media.

And now, Team Sparrow presents you a retro game demake----Crash Bandicoot!

Why don't play our demake when you have nothing to do at home or quarantine?

The demo is free to play, with 3 complete maps. And the full version will launch after the insider review.

You can also view our project on GitHub, [Click Here](https://github.com/Lactorsj/Crash-Bandicoot-Demake).



### Crowdfunding

About crowdfunding, we launched our project at Ulule, you can see our project home page by [click here](https://www.ulule.com/01G6JK3YXPQ0KREJJ5HZFR23FD/).

However, due to the nationality limit of Ulule, we don't have any available invoice address, so we cannot submit the project to public. So we find another way to crowdfunding: A Campaign on social network.

We raise a hashtag: #TeamSparrowGame at April when we start developing this project. Since then, about 100 students from HEBUT and other university join our insider preview Kook(Chinese version of Discord) server.

They downloaded our source code from GitHub or directly from our server. We hear from them a lot and we make a lot of improvement thanks to our community.

This Campaign closed at July 3rd, 2022. We'll give some little gift to those who provided significent suggestions.
